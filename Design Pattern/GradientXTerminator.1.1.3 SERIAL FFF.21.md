Gradients are a common problem in astrophotography, especially when shooting from light-polluted areas. They can ruin the appearance of your images by creating uneven brightness and color across the sky. Fortunately, there is a powerful tool that can help you eliminate gradients from your astro images: GradientXTerminator.

GradientXTerminator is a plug-in for Photoshop that can remove gradients of any shape and size from your images. It works by analyzing the image and creating a smooth background model that matches the gradient. Then, it subtracts the background model from the image, leaving only the stars and other objects. You can adjust the parameters of the plug-in to fine-tune the result and preserve the details of your image.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use GradientXTerminator to improve your astro images. We will use an example image of the Orion Nebula that has a strong gradient from light pollution. You can download the image here[^1^] and follow along with us.
 
## Step 1: Install GradientXTerminator
 
To use GradientXTerminator, you need to have Photoshop installed on your computer. You can download a free trial version of Photoshop here[^2^]. Then, you need to download and install GradientXTerminator from here. The plug-in costs $49.95, but you can try it for free for 30 days.
 
After installing GradientXTerminator, you need to activate it with a serial number. You can get a serial number by purchasing the plug-in or requesting a trial license. To activate the plug-in, go to Photoshop > Filter > RC-Astro > GradientXTerminator > Activate License and enter your serial number.
 
## Step 2: Open Your Image in Photoshop
 
Next, you need to open your image in Photoshop. You can do this by going to File > Open and selecting your image file. Make sure your image is in 16-bit or 8-bit mode, grayscale or RGB color. You can check this by going to Image > Mode.
 
## Step 3: Run GradientXTerminator
 
Now, you are ready to run GradientXTerminator on your image. Go to Filter > RC-Astro > GradientXTerminator and a dialog box will appear. Here, you can adjust the settings of the plug-in to suit your image.

- **Aggressiveness:** This controls how much of the gradient is removed from the image. A higher value will remove more gradient, but may also remove some details or create artifacts. A lower value will preserve more details, but may leave some gradient behind. The default value is 50%, which works well for most images.
- **Sampling Radius:** This controls how large of an area is used to calculate the background model. A larger radius will create a smoother background model, but may also blur some details or create halos around bright objects. A smaller radius will preserve more details, but may also create a noisy background model or fail to capture large-scale gradients. The default value is 32 pixels, which works well for most images.
- **Smoothing:** This controls how much smoothing is applied to the background model before subtracting it from the image. A higher value will create a smoother background model, but may also blur some details or create halos around bright objects. A lower value will preserve more details, but may also create a noisy background model or fail to capture large-scale gradients. The default value is 50%, which works well for most images.

You can also adjust other settings such as Background Color Balance, Foreground Color Balance, Foreground Brightness Adjustment, and Foreground Contrast Adjustment to fine-tune the result.
 
After adjusting the settings, click OK and wait for the plug-in to process your image. Depending on the size and complexity of your image, this may take a few seconds or minutes.
 
## Step 4: Compare Before and After
 
Once GradientXTerminator finishes processing your image, you can compare the before and after results by toggling the visibility of the layer
