One of the key features of SpaceClaim 2014 is its ability to work with any CAD data, regardless of the source or format. This means that engineers can import, repair and modify geometry from any online source, such as websites, cloud services or online libraries. SpaceClaim 2014 can also export models to various formats, such as STL, STEP, IGES or DXF, for sharing or collaborating with other engineers on the internet[^1^].
 
Another feature of SpaceClaim 2014 is its intuitive and easy-to-use interface, which allows engineers to create and edit models without having to learn complex CAD commands or theory. SpaceClaim 2014 uses direct modeling technology, which lets engineers manipulate geometry directly with simple mouse clicks and drags. This way, engineers can focus on the design intent and not on the software tools[^1^].
 
SpaceClaim 2014 also offers specialized tools for different engineering applications, such as sheet metal modeling, motion dynamics, jig and fixture design and additive manufacturing. These tools enable engineers to optimize their models for specific purposes and requirements. For example, SpaceClaim 2014 can automatically unfold sheet metal parts into flat patterns for fabrication or generate support structures for 3D printing[^1^].
 
In conclusion, SpaceClaim 2014 is a powerful and versatile 3D modeling software that can help engineers increase their productivity and efficiency on the internet. By working with any CAD data, using an intuitive interface and having access to specialized tools, engineers can create and edit models faster and easier than ever before.
