One of the most popular emulators for arcade games is DEMUL, which can run games from various platforms such as Sega Dreamcast, Naomi, Atomiswave, and Hikaru. DEMUL supports a wide range of arcade games, from fighting games like Street Fighter III and Marvel vs Capcom 2, to racing games like Daytona USA and Crazy Taxi, to shooting games like House of the Dead 2 and Virtua Cop 2.
 
To play arcade games on your PC with DEMUL, you will need two things: the emulator itself and the ROMs of the games you want to play. ROMs are files that contain the data of the original game cartridges or discs. You can find many ROMs online, but be careful to only download the ones that you own legally.
 
One of the easiest ways to get a collection of arcade ROMs is to download the DEMUL 0.5.6 ARCADE ROMS Pack.epub file, which contains over 100 arcade games in one convenient package. This file is an epub file, which is a format used for ebooks. To open it, you will need an epub reader software such as Calibre or Adobe Digital Editions.
 
Once you have downloaded and opened the DEMUL 0.5.6 ARCADE ROMS Pack.epub file, you will see a list of arcade games with their cover images and descriptions. To extract the ROMs from the epub file, you will need a software that can handle zip files such as WinRAR or 7-Zip. Simply right-click on the game you want to play and choose "Extract files..." from the menu. You will then get a zip file containing the ROM of the game.

Some tips and tricks for playing arcade games on your PC with DEMUL are:
 
- Make sure you have a powerful PC that can handle the emulation of arcade games. DEMUL requires a lot of CPU and GPU resources to run smoothly, especially for 3D games. You may need to lower the resolution or disable some effects if you experience lag or slowdowns.
- Use a controller that is compatible with DEMUL and comfortable for you. Playing arcade games with a keyboard and mouse can be difficult and frustrating. You can use any controller that can connect to your PC via USB or Bluetooth, such as an Xbox controller, a PlayStation controller, or an arcade stick. You can also customize the button layout and sensitivity in the controller settings of DEMUL.
- Save your progress frequently. Unlike console or PC games, arcade games do not have a save feature. You can only continue playing by inserting more coins or credits. However, DEMUL has a save state feature that allows you to save and load your game at any point. To use this feature, press F5 to save your game and F7 to load your game. You can also change the save state slot by pressing F6.
- Explore the different options and features of DEMUL. DEMUL has many options and features that can enhance your gaming experience. For example, you can change the region and language of the game, enable cheats and hacks, adjust the volume and sound effects, take screenshots and record videos, and more. You can access these options and features by pressing TAB during the game or by clicking on "Config" in the main menu of DEMUL.
